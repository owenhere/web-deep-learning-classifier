# Training the Image Classifier & Creating a Web App

This project was completed jointly by [Nidhin Pattaniyil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nidhinpattaniyil/) and [Reshama Shaikh](https://reshamas.github.io).

The following were used for model **training**:    
- fastai:  version 1.0.34
- PyTorch:  version  1.0 
- Python:  version 3.6

The following were used for model **deployment**:    
- Heroku
- Flask:  version 1.0
 

## Table of Contents
1.  [Training the Model](docs/1_training.md) using fastai:  [food classifier notebook](https://github.com/npatta01/food-classifier/blob/master/notebooks/1_train_large.ipynb)
2.  [Deploying the App on Heroku](2_heroku_app.md):  our web app is [food-img-classifier.herokuapp.com](https://food-img-classifier.herokuapp.com)
3.  Deploying a Mobile App, see this repo:  [npatta01/mobile-deep-learning-classifier](https://github.com/npatta01/mobile-deep-learning-classifier)
